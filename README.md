# Cheapest-path-algorithm
This program is written in C++, which will generate a random mountain terrain and places an object at a random location. Next, the program will calculate the most optimal path for the object to exit the terrain. This project was a simulation of GPS but for mountain highlands. The concept of Dijkstra's algorithm has been used. As an output the program will display the trajectory of the object.
To run the program along with any IDE, gnuplot package should be installed.
